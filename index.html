	<h1>Hi, I'm Natalie! I help build products that help others learn and hopefully
	become more curious about the world. </h1>
	<p>By day, I'm a Product Manager at <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>,
		where I focus on expanding access to free educational resources for learners outside the US.
		I'm passionate about the intersection of knowledge, technology and social equity, and see
		myself as optimistic and solution-oriented. </p>
	<p>Outside of work, I teach yoga and spend a lot of time making bad puns.</p>
